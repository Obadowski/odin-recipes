    <img src="arrozverde.webp" alt="A picture of a bowl with arroz verde with small green leafs (chiles)">
    <p>Arroz verde is normally made with poblano peppers. My family likes spicy food so I have elevated the heat in this green rice by using Hatch chiles. If you are sensitive to heat, use poblano peppers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Hatch green chiles.</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain rice.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of diced onion.</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, passed.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon, such as Knorr.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cummin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And how to make this marvellous food?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place Hatch chiles directly on the grates of a gas stove. Cook over medium heat, flipping with tongs occasionally, until blackened and charred, about 5 minutes. Place in a sealed plastic bag and allow to cool, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel off charred skins; remove seeds. Place chiles, chicken broth and cilantro in the jar of a blender and blend until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until it shimmers; add rice and onion. Cook and stir until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken bouillon, salt, and cumin. Add chile mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until rice is tender, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
